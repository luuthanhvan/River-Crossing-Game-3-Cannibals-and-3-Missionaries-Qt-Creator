Rules:
- There are 3 Missionaries and 3 Cannibals.
- They all have to cross a river in a boat.
- Boat can only carry two people at a time.
- As long as there are equal number of Missionaries and Cannibals, then Cannibals will not eat Missionaries.
- If the number of Cannibals are greater than the number of Missionaries on the same side of the river,
then Cannibals will eat the Missionaries.
- So how can we make all the 6 peoples to arrive to the other side safely?
